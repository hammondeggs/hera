### installation

Ensure you have the KORG minilogue xd / prologue sound librarian installed. Now, before you do anything else, **perform a full and complete backup of your synthesizer and save this to disk before continuing**. See the sound librarian manual for instructions on how to do this if required.

Next, select the USER MODULATION EFFECTS tab on the librarian, and press Receive ALL to upload your existing user oscillators. Now, drag and drop the requisite file to an available slot in the librarian :
 - for minilogue xd users, please use hera.mnlgxdunit
 - for prologue users, please use hera.prlgunit for now, please note this has NOT been tested on a prologue yet.

You should now see hera V1.00-1 listed in your user modulation effects. Press "Send All" under USER OSC / FX to send all of your user oscillator / effects to your synthesizer.

*please note if you do not do this correctly you may run the risk of losing data. As always, backup, backup, backup!*

### usage

This chorus emulates a dual bucket brigade style chorus commonly found on 80's synthesizers. The controls are as follows:
Time/Speed : Controls the LFO rate from 0 to 10hz

Depth: This is a dual function control, but primarily controls the intensity / depth of the LFO from %0 to %100. In addition, it allows you to choose if you want to mix the original sound as is (in phase) or inverted 


#### Play around with the settings and have fun!
